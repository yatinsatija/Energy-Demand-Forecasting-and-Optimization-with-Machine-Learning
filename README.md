# Energy-Demand-Forecasting-and-Optimization-with-Machine-Learning

## Overview
This project explores advanced machine learning and optimization techniques to forecast electricity demand and optimize grid resource allocation. It leverages time-series data and external variables such as weather and calendar effects to enhance predictive accuracy. The work demonstrates the application of supervised learning models, deep learning architectures, and optimization algorithms for energy management.

## Key Features
- **Time-Series Analysis:** Seasonal decomposition and exponential smoothing to identify demand trends and cycles.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Classification models (Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, SVM) and regression models (Linear Regression, Neural Network) for electricity demand forecasting.
- **Optimization:** Linear programming to optimize energy resource allocation during high-demand periods.
- **Visualization:** Time-series plots, seasonal decomposition, and model performance metrics for effective reporting.
